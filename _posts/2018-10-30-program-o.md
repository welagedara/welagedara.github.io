## Introduction

[AIML][aiml] Chatbots used to be quite popular back in the day when popular tools today like IBM's Dialog Tool and Diagflow are in their infancy. 

Even though AIML Frameworks do not carry the complexity of the Modern Day Frameworks, you may consider using AIML since it is Free and Open Source.

[Program-O][program_o] provides a PHP MySQL AIML Framework for managing your Chatbots. The REST interface in Program-O can be used to integrate the Chatbot with your Applications.

## Installation

Create a Database in your MySQL Server. Clone the Repo into an Apache + PHP installation. You might want to set the correct permission level for the directories if you are on a Unix based Operating System.

Now hit the URL from your browser. The browser will guide you through the installation.

## Testing

Download an AIML file from internet or create your own AIML file. Upload it. Then start chatting.
