Production Kubernetes with DevOps can get insanely complicated due to the many tools, many integrations and many uncertain areas associated with it. 

I am going to take a stab at building one. I want to see what I can come up with within two weeks time. I am only going to visualize what I need to have today. The best way to do that for me is to create a few slides. I hope having these slides will help me remember the whole setup in the future.

A PDF version of the slides is available [here](/artifacts/visualization.pdf).

{% assign image = "s1.jpg" %}
{% assign alt = "Visualization" %}
{% include srcset.html %}

{% assign image = "s2.jpg" %}
{% assign alt = "Visualization" %}
{% include srcset.html %}

{% assign image = "s3.jpg" %}
{% assign alt = "Visualization" %}
{% include srcset.html %}

{% assign image = "s4.jpg" %}
{% assign alt = "Visualization" %}
{% include srcset.html %}
