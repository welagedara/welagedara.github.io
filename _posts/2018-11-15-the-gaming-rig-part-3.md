You might want to protect your electronic components from being destroyed by ESD( Electrostatic Discharge). 

## Here's what I did.

### Work on a tiled floor on a wooden table

Carpet floors tend to help build electrostatic discharge. Therefore try to find a hard floor to work on. Oh, and work barefoot. Use a wooden table without a table cloth.
{% assign image = "6-rig.png" %}
{% assign alt = "Floor" %}
{% include srcset.html %}


### Increase the humidity in the room

Electrostatic build up seems to be higher when the humidity is low. Therefore run your humidifier if you've got one.

{% assign alt = "Humidity" %}
{% include srcset.html %}

### Use an Anti Static Wrist Band

This is how you correctly do that. Attach your PSU to the Casing with the screws included with the Casing. Connect your PSU to power and keep it off. Connect cable from the Wrist Band to an unpainted surface in your Casing. 

If you cannot find an unpainted surface, use one of your motherboard standoffs to attach the PSU to the casing. Connect the Wrist Wrap cable to the standoff. I had to scrape the paint off of the standoff because it was painted as well.

{% assign alt = "Anti Static Wrist Band" %}
{% include srcset.html %}

Note: Do not buy any Wireless Anti Static Wrist Bands. You have to ground yourself in order to get rid of the Static Electricity.

### Keep touching unpainted surfaces in your Casing when the PSU is attached to it

Doing this will get rid of any Static Charge build up.

### Keep your electronics inside their Anti Static Bags; Not on them

Do not keep your electronics on those Anti Static Bags. If you need a surface to keep the Motherboard use its box.

### Almost forgot. Wear cotton clothes.

Wear some cotton clothes. Do not wear baggy clothes. 

## Do I really had to do all of those things?

Not really. Static Electricity might be a problem if you keep dancing on a carpet while building your PC. 

Nonetheless I paid for the stuff and this build ain't cheap and I ain't gonna break them by being negligent.
