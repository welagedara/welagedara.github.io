The next thing you want after purchasing your new domain is to get an email address with that domain name.

I decided to use [Mailgun][mailgun] for that since maintaing your own mail servers is a cumebrsome task. I am not going to create a new Mailgun account since I already have one. You might have to enter your Credit Card information when you register. But you will not be charged untill you send more than 10 000 emails a month.

So here are the steps.

## Add a new domain 

I will be using the root domain despite their warnings. They are just warning you about your root domain getting flagged if you send lots of spam emails( I am safe because I am not going to send spam mails :blush:)

{% assign image = "mg.png" %}
{% assign alt = "Register your Domain" %}
{% include srcset.html %}

## Add the DNS entries

Add these DNS records to your Domain
{% assign image = "mg1.png" %}
{% assign alt = "DNS" %}
{% include srcset.html %}

This is how it looks like in GoDaddy( Remember sometimes `@` points to the root domain)
{% assign image = "mg2.png" %}
{% assign alt = "DNS" %}
{% include srcset.html %}

Click `Check DNS Records Now` button to verify the DNS entries. You are done when all the ticks are green.
{% assign image = "mg3.png" %}
{% assign alt = "DNS" %}
{% include srcset.html %}

## Add the route

Under `Routes` add new route to forward the emails to an existing email address of yours.
{% assign image = "mg4.png" %}
{% assign alt = "DNS" %}
{% include srcset.html %}

## The problem

The mail I sent to `info@pubudu.online` did not get delivered. The error message says the domain is not verified. Looks like my domain has got disabled. There is no button to enable that.
{% assign image = "mg5.png" %}
{% assign alt = "DNS" %}
{% include srcset.html %}

I had to raise a ticket to get the issue resolved. I will create a follow up post when I get a response from Mailgun.
