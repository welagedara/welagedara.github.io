This is something pretty straight forward. There are two options for you to do that. 

## Use the API

Send a `Basic Authenticated` `POST` request with `from`, `to`, `subject` and `text` in `form-data` to the URL shown. Use your own domain in the URL. 

Note that `Basic Authentication` sends `Base64` encoded username and password seperated by a colon as the `Authorization` header.

{% assign image = "mg7.png" %}
{% assign alt = "Postman" %}
{% include srcset.html %}

## Use an SMTP Client

The other option is to use an SMTP Client. Your SMTP credentials will be there under your domain.

{% assign image = "mg8.png" %}
{% assign alt = "Postman" %}
{% include srcset.html %}

## No Incoming Mail Server Support in Mailgun

I noticed that [Mailgun does not have POP3/IMAP][disabled]. Therfore only option to receive emails will be by forwarding the emails to an existing inbox.
